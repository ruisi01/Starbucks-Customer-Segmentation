# Starbucks-Customer-Segmentation

## Customer Segmentation
Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a companyâ€™s customers into groups that reflect similarity among customers in each group.
The goal is to help you better understand your customers and meet their unique needs. This can help you effectively and efficiently meet their expectations, which helps to increase their engagement with your products or service, and finally increase the transactions or revenues.

## Data Information
The data was from a survey conducted by Starbucks. Including following variables:

Gender, Age Groups, Employment, Income, Visit Frequency , In or Out, Time Spent, Distance, Membership, Frequent Buys, Spend per Visit, Likely to Meet Friends, Promotion Channels, Promotion Importance, Ambiance rating, Wifi rating, Service rating, Quality Rating, Price Rating, Continue or not

## Methodology
There are many ways in customer segmentation. You could segment by single variable, such as age, occupation, income, or behaviours, etc. Or you could segment by using multi-variables. 

In this analysis project, we use K-modes clustering algorithm, which is a variant of K-means. K-means can only be used to cluster numerical variables, while K-modes was designed for categorical variables. Since our survey data were all categorical variables, so we use K-modes.
First, the data were visualized by Tableau, then K-modes clustering were applied by Python to make customer segmentation.
